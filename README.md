# SE-Project
This repository is part of a group assignment to practice version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub. Each member will work on individual branches, make commits, and use pull requests for merging code into the main branch. The final project will be submitted once all features are integrated.

Key Tasks:

1. Repository Creation
A team member has set up this repository, complete with a README file that outlines the project's goals, team members, and their assigned tasks.

2. Collaborators
The repository owner has invited three team members to contribute. Together, we will use GitHub's collaboration features such as issues, comments, and pull requests to manage development.

3. Git Workflow
Each member will contribute by:
- Creating branches for individual features.
- Making at least three meaningful commits with clear messages.
- Submitting pull requests for review and merging code into the main branch.

4. Final Submission
Once all features are developed and integrated into the main branch, the final project will be submitted via the shared GitHub link.
